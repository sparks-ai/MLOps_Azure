## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. The dataset contains data about financial and personal details of customers of a bank. Based on this data, Azure will be used to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and finally consume it. Besides, a pipeline will be created, published and consumed.
